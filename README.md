# Biggening Corporation
A silly incremental style community game using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central as the engine to demonstrate AL Development techniques.

# Core Concept:
Players are building a Companyâ€™s overall wealth in a seasonal competition for Biggest Corporation.  But, for mysterious lack of staffing reasons, they can only use bots to create items and transactions.  Bots have limited abilities and limited resources.  Using those limited bots, players will slowly grow and improve their corporation.
